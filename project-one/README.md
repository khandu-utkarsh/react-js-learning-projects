## Project Title: Primitive Web Page with React and Bootstrap

### Description:

This project showcases a very basic web page built using React and Bootstrap, implemented with the help of Vite. The primary aim was to create a simple interface and overcome initial setup hurdles.

### Setup Instructions:

To replicate this project, follow these steps:

1. Execute the command `npm create vite@latest` and specify the directory name (e.g., vite-project).
2. Navigate into the 'vite-project' directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Start the development server with `npm run dev`.

### Challenges Encountered:

Throughout the development process, the following challenges were faced:

1. **Initial Setup:** The first hurdle involved figuring out how to create the page using JSX code. Due to the discontinuation of support for create-react-app by Meta, research led to the adoption of the Vite app.
2. **ESLint Configuration:** Vite app is stringent in its JavaScript usage, employing React ESLint. This initially caused compilation issues. A workaround was found by referring to a Stack Overflow article ([Link to Stack Overflow article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38684925/react-eslint-error-missing-in-props-validation)).

After addressing these challenges, the project began to function as intended.
